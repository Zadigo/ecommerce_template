# Analytics Application

This application simplifies the utilization of analytics tags in your Django project.

## Getting started

```
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        "OPTIONS": {
            "context_processors": [
                ...
                analytics.context_processors.analytics
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

Once the `Analytics` database is created, you can simply store your tags and they will persist in the templates.
